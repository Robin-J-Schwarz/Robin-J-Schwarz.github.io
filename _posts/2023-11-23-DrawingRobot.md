During my exchange semester in Norway at the University of Agder (UiA), I took the course Robotics. The course focused on the concepts of kinematics of industrial robots and path planning. As the final project me and two fellow students programmed an UR5 robot to draw an image with a marker. The project included the setup of the ROS environnement in Ubuntu 20.04, the image processing pipeline using OpenCV and the path planning from a random black and white image. 

### Results
