During my exchange semester in Norway at the University of Agder (UiA), I took the Industrial IT course. The course focused on the programming and concepts of PLCs, specifically Beckhoff PLCs. As a final project, I and three other students programmed the PLC of a three-phase oil separator. We developed the sequence of the whole system and implemented it using TwinCAT. We also designed a PID controller, which was simulated in MATLAB before implementation. A HIM was added to control the system and finally the implemented controller was extensively tested and documented.
