During my exchange semester in Norway at the University of Agder (UiA), I took the course Industrial IT. The course focused on the programming and concepts of PLCs, specifically PLCs from Beckhoff. As the final project me and three students programmed the PLC of an three-phase oil separator. We developed the sequence of the entire system and implemented it using TwinCAT. We also designed a PID controller which was simulated in MATLAB before implementation. A HIM was added to control the system and finally the implemented controller was extensively tested and documented.
