During my exchange semester in Norway I took the course machine vision. The course focused on the concepts of image processing and working with tools like OpenCV and machine vision to solve problems.

For our final projects me and two fellow students developed the Advanced Chessboard Recognition and Optical Notation Yielding Mechanism (or short ACRONYM), with the goal to convert an image of an over-the-board chess game into a digital representation of the current position. The user should be able to take a picture on their phone which is then converted into the Forsythâ€“Edwards chess notation system (FEN).

First, we use different filters, colour spaces and edge detection to detect the corners of the chess board. Then we use edge and line detection to find the corners of each individual square. Using the square corner points we crop the square to size in order to feed them to a CNN using VGG16. With the prediction from the CNN we are able to define the location of all pieces on the board and convert them to FEN notation. The predictions had an accuracy of about 90 %.
