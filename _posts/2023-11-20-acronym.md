During my exchange semester in Norway I took the course computer vision. For our final projects me and two other students designed an application that is able to convert an image of a chess board position into a digital chess notation format (FEN). First, we use different filters, colour spaces and edge detection to detect the corners of the chess board. Then we use edge and line detection to find the corners of each individual square. Using the square corner points we crop the square to size in order to feed them to a CNN using VGG16. With the prediction from the CNN we are able to define the location of all pieces on the board and convert them to FEN notation. The predictions had an accuracy of about 90 %.
